\section{Further work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Dataset: improve it, enlarge with more and more variate images, better classify them, even anotate with more categories of actual objects appearing, consider annotating areas, and train a model to detect this particular patterns. Yet, all this would diverge from the original scope of the project,
	\item Model: CNN feature extraction, other architectures and number of activations, layers, neurons, training epochs. Make a more robust pipeline, load images on batches, so a larger dataset can be considered. Implement some sort of data augmentation if needed
	\item Results: further study on which images the models fail, what kind of information is learning (patters, colors, shapes, etc)
	\item Conclusions: further analysis costs of such implementations, environment impact, etc
\end{itemize}
