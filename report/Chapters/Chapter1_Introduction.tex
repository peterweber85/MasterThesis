\section{Motivation}

BigEarthNet Motivation:
Existing Remote Sensing Datasets contain a small number of annotated images and therefore do not suffice to train a complex ConvNet with many different parameters.
Remote sensing versus Computer (Using pretrained nets on ImageNet)


BagOfVisualWords: useless



Extreme value theory-based calibration: useless




Climate Change, population control, ilegal habitat/ilegal land use


The goal is not really to build the top performance, state-of-the-art model to detect all sort of human impact in satellite images, but rather to analyze the feasibility and cost of doing so at differen resolutions. Of course, better algorithms could be implemented to accurately identify certain types of human impact, but we consider a more general problem.
