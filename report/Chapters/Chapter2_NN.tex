\section{Introduction to Deep Learning}

Deep Learning (DL) models have led to vast performance improvements in a large variety of domains, and therefore have gained substantial popularity over the last decade. These models were initially inspired by the human brain and analogies in neuroscience, which is why this class of algorithms was coined neural networks (NN). The two most popular neural network architectures are convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). CNNs have driven major breakthroughs in visual object recognition \parencite{krizhevsky2012}, and image \parencite{zhang2015}, video \parencite{tompson2014} and audio \parencite{hinton2012} processing while RNNs brought about advances in research and applications on sequential data, i.e. in speech and text \parencite{collobert2011}. However, the superior performance of Neural Networks compared to traditional machine learning algorithms is not limited to the aforementioned domains. Other fields in which NNs have advanced the state-of-the-art include, for instance, bioinformatics \parencite{junshui2015} and the analysis of data from elementary particle physics \parencite{ciodaroc2012}.

Neural networks define a class of models that are composed of a variable number of processing layers (Hidden units) of simple models, and are generally used to map a fixed size input (e.g. the pixels of an image) to a fixed size output (e.g. a category or a probability). A Hidden unit of a fully connected (FC) neural network has connections between all the nodes of the previous layer and the next layer. These connections are fully parametrized by the weights of the network. In analogy to a firing neuron, a non-linear activation function is applied to the output of the nodes of every Hidden unit. Historically, sigmoid ($\sigma(x) = 1/(1 + exp(-x))$) and tanh ($tanh(x) = 2\sigma(2x) - 1$) have been used as activation functions. Nowadays, the most popular activation function is the rectified linear unit (ReLU, $f(x) = max(0,x)$). We will see the reason for this at the end of the section. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:simple_neural_net}(a) we show an example of a fully connected feedforward 3-layer neural network. 

The strength of neural networks lies in their ability to learn arbitrarily complex non-linear input-output mappings \parencite{cybenko1989}, and that they can automatically extract features from raw data. The latter is in stark cotrast to traditional machine learning algorithms, which require careful feature engineering. For instance, when dealing with images, the multi layer architecture of neural networks allows to learn different features at every stage of the network, where the complexity and the abstraction of the learned features increases at every layer \parencite{farabet2013}.

	\caption{\textbf{Example of 3-Layer Neural Network.} \textbf{(a)} Feed-forward representation of a neural network with two hidden units H1 and H2 and a binary output unit. The inputs to every layer are weighted averages, specified by the weights $w$, of the outputs of the previous layer. In every layer, the outputs are generated by applying a non-linear function to the inputs. The most popular function for this purpose is the ReLu (see text). \textbf{(b)} Back-propagation of the error in order to learn the optimal weights of the neural network. The error is quantified by a loss function $E$ at the output of the neural network, which is a measure of the discrepancy between the desired output and the actual output of the network. During backpropagation the chain-rule is applied recursively to the loss function in a backward manner. Specifically, at every layer the derivative of the error with respect to the inputs is computed by mutlipliying the upstream gradient with the local gradient. The upstream gradient is the derivative of the loss function with respect to the output of each unit, which is a weighted sum of the input derivatives of the layer above. The local gradient is the derivative of the non-linear function $f(z)$ with respect to its inputs. Starting from the output of the network one finally obtains the derivative of the loss function with respect to all weights, so that the network can minimze the loss by adjusting the weights.

As all machine learning models, deep learning models are trained by minimizing an objective function, i.e. by finding the optimal set of weights that achieve a specific input-output mapping. The minimization of the objective function is accomplished by applying gradient descent based methods, in practice, often  stochastic gradient descent \parencite{bottou2008} or variants of it \parencite{diederik2015}. The computation of the gradient of the objective function with respect to all weights of the network is accomplished using backpropagation \parencite{rumelhart1986} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:simple_neural_net}(b)).
Intuitively, the backpropagation algorithm helps to quantify the influence of every weight of the network on the final error, so that one can decrease the error by updating the weights in the direction of the negative gradient.

Although artifical neural networks have been known and studied since the 1950s, it was only understood in the 1980s that mutlitlayer networks could be trained by backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent \parencite{lecun1989}. However, until recently, neural networks were still ignored by the computer-vision and speech-recognition communities, because of the believe that the objective function would get trapped in local minima. 

The advent of several new methods and technologies shall prove wrong the scepticism towards feasibly training deep neural networks. A requirement to reliable train large neural networks is the availability of large amounts of labelled data, as well as the necessary processing power. Both became available with the emergence of "Big Data" and new powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) about a decade ago.
Also theoretical advances helped to eliviate the difficulties to train deep learning models. These include the application of the ReLU non-linearity \parencite{glorot2011}, which solved the vanishing gradient problem, as well as the development of a particular type of NNs, the convolutional neural networks. These networks are much easier to train than conventional FC networks, have less parameters, and they generalize better to unseen data. 

\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}
Convolutional neural networks \parencite{vaillant1993, lecun1998} are specifically designed to process input data that has the shape of multiple arrays, such as the pixel values of a 2-dimensional image with three color channels. This is accomplished by using additional layers to preserve spatial structure. In general, a CNN is composed of several convolutional layers followed by a nonlinearity. These are often followed by a pooling layer, and a fully connected layer is used as the last layer of the network. The architecture of a small VGG convolutional net \parencite{simonyan2014}  used for classification is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:convnet}.

With this design, CNNs take advantage of the natural properties of images. The central element here is the convolutional layer, which takes into account that local pixel values are highly correlated, and that the local statistics of images are invariant to translation \parencite{lawrence1997}. In particular, in a convolutional layer several small filters are slided spatially over the image computing dot products at every spatial location. The filters always extend the full depth of the input volume. For instance, a typical filter for a 3 color channel image might have dimensions $5 \times 5 \times 3$. Sliding this filter over an image of size, say  $32\times32\times3$, would lead to an activation map with dimensions $28\times28\times1$. 

The activation map is produced with one set of weights that belong to this particular filter. This concept is referred to as shared weights, which means that a comparatively small number of weights is shared across the entire image. As it is the case with conventional neural networks the weights, or parameters, are learned by applying gradient descent and backprogagation.  The number of weights, or parameters, per filter is given by the spatial filter size, times the depth of the image plus a bias term. In the usual case of multiple filters the number of parameters is multiplied by K, which corresponds to having K activation maps. Typically many filters are applied at every convolutional layer, so that every filter learns a set of weights that relate to one particular feature in the image (see Fig.~\ref{fig:convnet}(a)). 


\begin{figure}[h!]

	\captionsetup{width=1\linewidth}

	\caption{\textbf{Example...} Speak about activation maps. Visualizing a filter would show at which structure the filter is looking for in an image.}
	\label{fig:convnet}
\end{figure}

The dimensions of the output of every convolutional layer are controlled by three parameters: the stride S, zero-padding P, and the number of filters with size F. The stride is the interval at which the filter is slided over the image. Zero-padding has the porpuse to increase the image size by adding pixels with zero value at the border, so that the input and output dimensions can be matched (assuming stride is 1). For an input image of size W the output activation map will have
\begin{equation}
\frac{W - F +2P}{S} + 1
\end{equation}
pixels along every dimension.

	\label{fig:conv_pooling}
\end{figure}

Pooling layers introduce coarse-graining in order to create invariance to small shifts and to decrease the number of parameters, which makes the representations smaller and more manageable. A pooling layer is applied to every activation map independently. It downsamples its input, in the most common case, by applying a max operator. This is shown schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:conv_pooling}(b). Max-pooling with stride 2 would, for instance, transform a $4 \times 4$ input image to a $2 \times 2$ output image by taking the maximum element at every 2-by-2 location. Note that pooling layers don't have any parameters.

When stacking together mutliple combinations of convolutional layers followed by non-linearities and pooling layers, the filters learn a hierarchichal structure. The filters at earlier layers learn simple low-level features such as edges whereas the filters at later stages learn more complex high-level features, which are compositions of lower level features. In conclusion, the deeper a convolutional neural network is the more complex compositions of features it can learn.


\section{CNN Architectures}
\textcolor{red}{CITE ALL THE NETWORKS}.
The AlexNet was the first network that achieved remarkable results in the ImageNet classification task in 2012, by halfing the error in comparison to all competing non deep learning based approaches (see Fig.~\ref{}). In this competition deep convolutional networks were applied to a dataset with roughly 1 million images and 1000 classes. At this point the milestone was set to a revolution in computer, and year over year deeper and better convolutional networks were developed ()
