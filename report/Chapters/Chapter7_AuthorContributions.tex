This thesis is a group project between Eduard Ribas Fern√°ndez and Peter Weber. Here we will describe the individual contributions of each author. Overall, both authors have contributed to all parts in this project with different weights in each part.

In the first major block, the generation of the dataset, the distribution is as follows. The image search and download of the raw images was performed by P. Weber, while programming the image processing pipeline was done by both authors with similar weight. The labeling of the processed images was also done by both authors.

In the second major block, the data analysis pipeline, P. Weber has higher contribution at the beginning of the pipeline i.e. prototyping first solutions using transfer learning. E. Ribas has higher contribution towards the end of the pipeline. This includes optimizing the code for Colab, tuning the hyperparamters, performing analysis per category and producing the final figures.
Regarding estimation of the cost, both authors have equal contribution.

The same applies for preparing all documents related to this project (Github repository, high-level overview, thesis document), both authors have equally contributed.
